# Introduction

The Conlang kit is meant to assist in the creation of constructed languages.
On a simple level, it can be used as a name, word, or sentence generator, but it also encompasses orthography, grammar,
phonetic shifts, and helps manage your lexicon (which can include borrowed words).

What distinguishes this toolkit from others is the focus on phonetics.
**It is meant to get to get you from zero to hearing a language spoken as quickly as possible.**
This allows for rapid iteration on adding or removing noises and patterns to get to something that sounds like what you
want.

### Biases

The author of this library is a native English speaker with a midwestern accent and is generally familiar with European
languages.
While the International Phonetic Alphabet is intended to capture vocalizations from around the world, the examples used
will have a Euro-centric bias.
This is especially evident in the lack of good support for non-pulmonic consonants.
